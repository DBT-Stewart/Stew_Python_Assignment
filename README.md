## Finding The Percentage
### Function: s_mark()
- Reads student names and their marks, stores them in a dictionary, and calculates the average marks for a queried student.

## Finding The Second Maximum Number
### Function: sec_large()
- Finds the second highest value in a list of integers by removing duplicates and sorting the list in ascending order.

## Mutations
### Function: mutate_string()
- Performs a character replacement at a specific index in a string, demonstrating string manipulation techniques.

## Merge The Tools
### Function: merge_the_tools()
- Splits a string into substrings of length k, removes duplicate characters from each substring while preserving the original order.

## String Formatting
### Function: print_formatted()
- Prints numbers from 1 to n in aligned columns showing their decimal, octal, hexadecimal, and binary representations.

## Text Alignment
### Function: generate_h_logo()
- Prints a stylized HackerRank logo using a specified character and thickness with properly aligned output.

## Calendar Module
### Function: get_day_name()
- Determines the day of the week for a given date provided in 'MM-DD-YYYY' format using the datetime module.

## Collection namedtuple()
### Function: namedtuple()
- Uses Pythonâ€™s namedtuple to read student records and calculate the average marks, rounded to two decimal places.

## Floor, Ceil and Rint
### Function: apply_rounding_operations()
- Reads a list of floating-point numbers and applies floor, ceiling, and rounding operations using NumPy.

## Min and Max
### Function: max_of_row_minimums()
- Calculates the maximum value among the minimum elements of each row in a 2D NumPy array.

## Linear Algebra
### Function: calculate_determinant()
- Reads a square matrix and computes its determinant using the numpy.linalg.det() function.

## Mean, Variance and Standard
### Function: calculate_stats()
- Computes the mean, variance, and standard deviation along rows of a 2D array using NumPy.

## Python Time Delta
### Function: time_delta()
- Calculates the absolute time difference in seconds between two timestamp strings using datetime.strptime().

## No Idea
### Function: calculate_happiness()
- Computes a happiness score by evaluating the presence of array elements in predefined "like" and "dislike" sets.

## Word Order
### Function: word_order_counter()
- Counts the frequency of words and returns both the count of unique words and their occurrences in order.

## Piling Up
### Function: can_stack()
- Determines whether a series of cubes can be stacked under the constraint that each placed cube must be less than or equal to the previous one.

## Iterables and Iterators
### Function: probability_of_a()
- Calculates the probability of selecting at least one target letter from a list during k selections using combinations and probability rules.

## Email Validation
### Function: is_valid_email()
- Validates a list of email addresses using regular expressions and returns those that match the specified pattern.
